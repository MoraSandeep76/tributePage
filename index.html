        <h2 class="text-center">ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Tyrion is a member of one of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, the sprawling and ancient noble
            dynasties that control Westeros.He grew up at Casterly Rock, the ancestral home of the noble house
            Lannister. Tyrion &apos;s childhood was marred by two tragedies, both occurring at birth. First, he was born
            a dwarf, a condition that caused his father to write him off. Secondly his mother died giving birth to him,
            an event that was obviously outside of his control, but one which his father and sister have never forgiven
            him for.
            He is clever, witty, and resilient. Tyrion has been mistreated his entire life, and has developed a cynicism
            as thick as armor in order to help himself cope. He has an acid tongue and is capable of talking his way
            through just about anything. Despite his dark world view and tendency to verbally brutalize anyone who gets
            in his way, Tyrion is generally a good man. He values kindness, goodness, and honor &#8208; he just
            recognizes
            that these things aren &apos;t always compatible with survival.</p>
